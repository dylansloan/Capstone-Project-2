# Capstone-Project-2
Recommendation System

With so many new options available for customers to watch and stream their favorite movies and TV shows it is key for companies to be able to stand out by providing the pertinent content for all their customers. Having the ability to accurately recommend new movies and TV shows for individual users keeps the user from venturing to another provider. Building a model to predict what combination of movie or TV show features, such as cast, director, genre will give the company insight to what additional content would be best to add to their library.

 I have acquired datasets from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Amazon, Netflix, and MovieLens. These datasets are vast enough to cover the scope of this project. They also allow me to break up the project into two possible routes; one focusing on a content level prediction and the other to focus on a user level prediction.
